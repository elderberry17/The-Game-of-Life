# The Game of Life

Here is one of my task from Tinkoff exam for ML&DL course and it is really shitty things yet

I must simulate a game named "Game of life" (like Scorpions's song, ha-ha) 

PyGame window freezes, when there is not active movements from user

It's bad, 'cause one should just see this life simulation with out any interventions

This process may be really long lasting, so one can't move her/his mouse all the time

Also there is not beautiful plot in the end (ha-ha) showing dynamic of this "society" population as I'd like it to be
